📊 Customer Churn Prediction – ANN | Streamlit App

End-to-end Machine Learning project that predicts customer churn using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and deploys the model as an interactive Streamlit web application.

Built with a production-ready ML pipeline: consistent preprocessing, saved encoders, feature alignment, and real-time inference.

🔍 What This Project Demonstrates

Applied Machine Learning & Deep Learning (ANN)

End-to-end workflow: training → serialization → deployment

Handling categorical encoding & feature scaling in production

Debugging real-world ML issues (feature mismatch, environments)

Building and deploying an ML app with Streamlit


🛠 Tech Stack

Python | TensorFlow/Keras | Scikit-learn | Pandas | NumPy | Streamlit

🚀 Key Features

Predicts customer churn probability in real time
