📊 Customer Churn Prediction – ANN (Streamlit App)

An end-to-end Machine Learning project that predicts customer churn using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and deploys the model as an interactive Streamlit web application.

The project demonstrates a production-ready ML pipeline, covering preprocessing, model training, deployment, and real-time inference.

🔍 What This Project Shows
